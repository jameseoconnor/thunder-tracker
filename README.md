## A thunder tracker to warn you about an iminent thunderstorm 
So we have a dog at home, called Alfie, who went missing on us twice during thunderstorms. So I created this function, which rums on AWS Lambda to monitor the weather near our house, by polling the accuweather API to see if any thunder has been forecast. An SNS is then sent to out to our family members to tell us to bring him inside. It works surprisingly well!
